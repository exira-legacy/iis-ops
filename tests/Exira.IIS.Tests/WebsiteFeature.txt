  In order to host their sites
  API users should be able to 
  Create websites in IIS based on their master DNS name (example.org)

    Given a server web1
    When I request a new website example.org on server web1
    Then a new website example.org should be added to server web1
    And a new binding www.example.org should be added to website example.org on server web1
